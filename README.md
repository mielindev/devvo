# Devvo - Fullstack Web Application

Devvo is a modern fullstack web application designed to showcase the integration of cutting-edge web technologies. This project serves as a learning and development platform for building scalable, performant, and user-friendly web applications. It leverages the power of Next.js for server-side rendering, dynamic routing, and API handling, making it a robust foundation for fullstack development.

## üìå Project Purpose

The goal of Devvo is to provide a comprehensive example of a fullstack application, demonstrating best practices in frontend and backend development. It includes features like theme customization, responsive design, and API integration, making it a great starting point for developers looking to build their own projects.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Custom Theme Provider**: A reusable `ThemeProvider` component for managing light and dark themes across the application.
- **Dynamic Routing**: Seamless navigation with Next.js' file-based routing system.
- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR) and Static Generation (SSG)**: Optimized performance with pre-rendering techniques.
- **API Endpoints**: Built-in API routes for handling backend logic and data fetching.
- **Responsive Design**: A mobile-first design approach to ensure compatibility across devices.
- **Font Optimization**: Automatic font loading and optimization using Next.js' `next/font` feature.
- **Scalable Architecture**: Modular and maintainable code structure for easy scalability.

## üõ† Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React, Next.js
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS (or CSS Modules, if applicable)
- **Backend**: Node.js, Next.js API routes
- **Deployment**: Vercel for fast and reliable hosting
